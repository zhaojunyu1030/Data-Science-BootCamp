1.⁠ ⁠How do you assess the statistical significance of an insight?
    - formulate a Null Hypothesis (H0)
    - formulate an Alternative Hypothesis (H1)
    - choose a Significance Level (alpha)
    - select and perform the Appropriate Statistical Test
    - compute the p-value
    - compare the p-value and alpha
    - make decision
    - conclusion
    
2.⁠ ⁠What is the Central Limit Theorem? Explain it. Why is it important?
    If sampling randomly and independently, the sample means distribute normally as the sample size increases, regardless of how the underlying population is distributed
    It allows us to use normal distribution techniques even if the original data is not normal.

3.⁠ ⁠What is the statistical power?
    The probability that a statistical test will correctly reject a false null hypothesis.
    p < 0.05

4.⁠ ⁠How do you control for biases?
    - randomization
    - blinding
    - control groups
    -sampling carefully

5.⁠ ⁠What are confounding variables?
    A third variable that influences both the independent variable and the dependent variable, creating a false association between them.

6.⁠ ⁠What is A/B testing?
    An experimental method where you compare two versions (A and B) of something to see which one performs better according to a chosen metric.
    Control group & treatment group

7.⁠ ⁠What are confidence intervals?
    A range of values that is likely to contain the true population parameter with a certain level of confidence.
